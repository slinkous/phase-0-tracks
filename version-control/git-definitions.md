# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is a system of documenting changes to a project so that it is easy to see what has been done, when, and by whom, at each step in its development. 

It allows for easy regression at errors, as well as mechanism for fusing two different copies of a file. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch defines a direction that a project could take. 

I would use it to maintain a stable copy of my original work while testing a new feature.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save. A good message is short, in imperative form, and states as specifically as possible what was changed at that point. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a scenario in which the automatic merge function cannot decide which of two possible changes should be saved into the final document.
