1. What are the design philosophies of Linux?
> Open Source. I've used it exclusively since 2007.
2. What is a VPS?
> A virtual machine on a remote server which can itself be enabled as a server. Allows more space and flexibility than a shared server, but less than your own dedicated server. 
3. Why not run programs as root in Linux?
> Root is best used for when you want to seriously modify the system. If you are just *using* the system, you should be a separate *user*.
